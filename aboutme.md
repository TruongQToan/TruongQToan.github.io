title: About me
---

My name is Toan Truong. I am a software in Vietnam. Although I love writing and sharing knowledge, I have not feel confident enough to try to start a blog for a long long time. Now, I am still not confident, but I decided to write a blog anyway. If I wait until the confidence comes to me, maybe I will never write anything.

This blog is mainly about Computer Science.
